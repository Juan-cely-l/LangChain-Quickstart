# Deliverable 1: LangChain Quickstart Basic Agent

This repository contains Deliverable 1 for a LangChain quickstart activity. The main objective is to build and run a basic agent with `create_agent`, connect tools, and generate a final response in a reproducible notebook workflow.

## Architecture and Components

The notebook follows this flow:

`User -> Agent (create_agent) -> Tools -> Response`

Components:
- User input: natural language request.
- Agent: orchestration logic created with LangChain `create_agent`.
- Tools: callable functions such as weather and user-location helpers.
- Response: final answer generated by the model, optionally structured.

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` locally and provide valid values. Do not commit `.env`.

## How to Run

1. Start Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. Open `notebooks/LLM-Chain.ipynb`.
3. Run all cells in order from top to bottom.

The first notebook cell loads `.env` with `python-dotenv`. If a required variable is missing, it requests the value through `getpass` without echoing sensitive input.

## Example Output

A non-sensitive example of a structured response is shown below:

```text
ResponseFormat(
  punny_response="Looks like you're in for a sun-sational day!",
  weather_conditions="It's always sunny in Florida!"
)
```

## Repository Layout

- `notebooks/LLM-Chain.ipynb`: Main tutorial notebook for the basic LangChain agent.
- `requirements.txt`: Direct dependencies required to run the notebook.
- `.env.example`: Template for local environment variables.
- `.gitignore`: Ignore rules for secrets, caches, virtual environments, and notebook checkpoints.
- `README.md`: Setup and execution guide for reproducibility.

## Security Notes

- Never commit API keys or secrets.
- Keep `.env` local only.
- Use `.env.example` as a public template with placeholders.
- Review notebook outputs before sharing to avoid exposing sensitive information.
